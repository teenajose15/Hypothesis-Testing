# Hypothesis Testing: Process and Implementation

## Overview
This repository provides a detailed explanation and implementation of **Hypothesis Testing**, a core statistical method used in data science to make data-driven decisions. It outlines the step-by-step process, including defining hypotheses, selecting the appropriate tests, and interpreting results with examples.

## What is Hypothesis Testing?
Hypothesis Testing is a statistical method to infer conclusions about populations using sample data. It helps determine whether observed results are statistically significant or due to random chance.

## Hypothesis Testing Process
Below is the step-by-step process for performing hypothesis testing:

1. **Gather Data**: Collect the data required for analysis.
2. **Define Hypotheses**:
   - Null Hypothesis (H0): The assumption that there is no effect or no difference.
   - Alternative Hypothesis (H1 or Ha): The assumption that there is an effect or a difference.
3. **Choose Significance Level (α)**:
   - Common choices for α are 0.05 or 0.01.
   - The significance level represents the probability of rejecting H0 when it is true.
4. **Select Statistical Test**:
   - Examples:
     - **T-Test**: Compare means between two groups.
     - **Chi-Square Test**: Analyze categorical data.
     - **ANOVA**: Compare means across more than two groups.
5. **Perform the Statistical Test**:
   - Use appropriate Python libraries like `scipy` or `statsmodels` for computation.
6. **Determine P-Value and Interpret Results**:
   - If `p-value < α`: Reject the null hypothesis (H0).
   - If `p-value ≥ α`: Fail to reject the null hypothesis.

## Example Implementation: T-Test
Here is an example of how to perform a **T-Test** in Python to compare the means of two groups:

```python
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Example data
group1 = [10, 12, 15, 9, 11]
group2 = [14, 16, 12, 15, 13]

# Perform an independent t-test
t_stat, p_value = ttest_ind(group1, group2, equal_var=False)

# Results
print("T-Statistic:", t_stat)
print("P-Value:", p_value)

# Interpret the results
if p_value < 0.05:
    print("Reject the null hypothesis: The means are significantly different.")
else:
    print("Fail to reject the null hypothesis: No significant difference between the means.")
